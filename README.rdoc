# Vibes

Vibes is an event planning and communication tool for music promoters and artists to connect with each other and post to the general public.
Artists and promoters can manage events and promote them through the dedicated platform. This system fills a much needed gap because the music industry is still using the rapidly declining and not industry specific  "Facebook Events"
